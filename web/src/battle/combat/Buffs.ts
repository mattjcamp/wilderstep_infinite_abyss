/**
 * Status-effect / buff state for combat.
 *
 * Mirrors the Python game's `bless_buffs` / `curse_buffs` /
 * `range_buffs` dicts at a slightly higher level: a single per-
 * combatant list of {kind, value, turnsLeft, source}. The combat
 * engine sums matching kinds at attack time and ticks every entry
 * down at the end of each round, expiring with a log line.
 *
 * Mechanical kinds shipped today:
 *   - attack_bonus   — added to the d20 hit roll (Bless +2,
 *                      Elixir of Strength +2)
 *   - ac_bonus       — added to the combatant's AC (Shield +1,
 *                      Elixir of Warding +2)
 *   - damage_bonus   — added to the post-dice damage total on melee
 *                      hits (Elixir of Strength). The Python game
 *                      models this as raising STR which feeds both
 *                      attack and damage; we split it into the two
 *                      buff kinds so the math stays explicit.
 *   - attack_penalty — subtracted from the d20 hit roll (Curse -2)
 *   - ac_penalty     — subtracted from the combatant's AC (Curse -2)
 *   - range_bonus    — added to baseMoveRange (Long Shanks +4)
 *
 * The full Python game also has skip_turn (Sleep) and side-flip
 * (Charm) status effects; they need turn-loop changes that are
 * separate from the numerical buffs covered here.
