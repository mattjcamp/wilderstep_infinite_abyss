/**
 * Shared bottom-of-viewport log strip used by every map scene
 * (Overworld, Town, Dungeon). Today it carries just the in-game
 * date/time and lunar phase; future iterations will surface
 * step-driven log lines (combat one-liners, "you spotted a trap",
 * etc.) into the same strip so the player has a single, predictable
 * place to look across all maps.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *   - `installSceneLog(scene)` creates the strip (background bar,
 *     moon Graphics, time Text) and returns a handle.
 *   - `refreshSceneLog(handle, clock)` repaints the time + moon.
 *     Cheap — call once per scene boot and once per move tick.
 *
 * Camera contract:
 *
 *   The strip is pinned to the bottom of the viewport via
 *   `setScrollFactor(0)`. Each scene's `setBounds` must extend the
 *   world height by `LOG_HEIGHT` so the camera can scroll the bottom
 *   row of tiles above the strip — without that, when the party
 *   stands at the bottom row of a tall map the player marker hides
 *   behind the log strip. See `OverworldScene.installCamera` for
 *   the canonical setup.
